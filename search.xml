    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Dijkstra used the Dutch National Flag Problem as a structured programming exercise in program derivation and program proof. Given N objects coloured red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same colour are adjacent, with the colours in the order red, white and blue. Similar Problem on LeetCode : 75. Sort ColorsGiven an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively. Note:You are not suppose to use the library’s sort function for this problem.click to show follow up. Follow up:A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.First, iterate the array counting number of 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s, then overwrite array with total number of 0’s, then 1’s and followed by 2’s.Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space? 1. Two-pass solution based on bucket sortObviously, this is a sort problem and it only contains 3 kinds of elements: red, white and blue, which reminds me of bucket sort. Use 3 integers to record the number of 3 colors in the 1st pass, then sort the array in the second pass. 123456789101112131415public class Solution &#123; public void sortColors(int[] A) &#123; int numRed = 0, numWhite = 0, numBlue = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; A.length; i++) &#123; if (A[i] == 0) numRed++; else if (A[i] == 1) numWhite++; else numBlue++; &#125; for (int i = 0; i &lt; A.length; i++) &#123; if (i &lt; numRed) A[i] = 0; else if (i &lt; numRed + numWhite) A[i] = 1; else A[i] = 2; &#125; &#125; &#125; 2. One-pass solution with 2 pointers in two waysAs follow-up requires, two-pass solution is not efficient enough. There should be one way to find elements and sort array at the same time. swap is used in this solution. Use two pointers end0 and head2 to record the end of 0 and the head of 2 during the process, respectively. At the beginning, end0 = 0, head2 = n - 1, where n is the length of array; When traverse all the elements, if it is 0, swap it with end0; If it is ‘2’, swap it with head2. Attention: if the element is 2, you cannot just swap it with head2 and go on, it may possible that the element at head2 is 0, so it is important to do extra check before moving on. On the contrary, the swap with end0 do not need extra check because element at end0 is sorted.12345678910111213141516171819public class Solution &#123; public void sortColors(int[] nums) &#123; int n = nums.length; int end0 = 0, head2 = n - 1, i = 0; while(i &lt;= head2) &#123; if(nums[i] == 0) swap(nums, end0++, i++); else if(nums[i] == 2) swap(nums, head2--, i); else i++; &#125; &#125; private void swap(int[] nums, int i1, int i2) &#123; int tmp = nums[i1]; nums[i1] = nums[i2]; nums[i2] = tmp; &#125;&#125; 3. One-pass solution with 3 pointers in one wayThere is one more easy way to solve this problem. The pointers only move in one way, and no swap is needed. All 3 pointers start from the head of array, record the end of 0,1,2.123456789101112131415161718public class Solution&#123; public void sortColors(int A[], int n) &#123; int n0 = -1, n1 = -1, n2 = -1; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) &#123; if (A[i] == 0) &#123; A[++n2] = 2; A[++n1] = 1; A[++n0] = 0; &#125; else if (A[i] == 1) &#123; A[++n2] = 2; A[++n1] = 1; &#125; else if (A[i] == 2) &#123; A[++n2] = 2; &#125; &#125;&#125;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. NodeJSNodeJS is a server-side language based on JavaScript. Its function likes PHP, Ruby. Its function includes handle requests parse data generate &amp; send responses file operations One of the most popular framework of NodeJS is Express, an superset to NodeJS, which includes many common test to make you focus on the core things. 2. Angular 2Angular 2 is running on Browser, provides reactive experience. No need for send request and wait for response, every thing of Angular 2 happens instantly. Angular 2 is a superset to javascript.Angular 2 has some figures:1.Single page It runs one single page and updates parts of the page which need updating 2.Updates DOMIt updates the DOM to read render parts of the page which need to be updated 3.Handles routing of visual partsit will not use server for the routing. Instead, every thing works at the front end to load things faster. 4.Very reactive user experience 3. How NodeJS and Angular 2 work together When using a server-side only application, the client do not need to do any thing, just get the resource from the server. But obviously, every change of the page should have a request to server, and take which slow down the reaction of the application. Single page application can do the rendering on the client, server just need to send data to client and client will do the rendering and generate the page itself. 4. Setting up project Go to nodejs.org to download and install the latest version nodejs Open the NodeJS project and use terminal to navigate to the project folder. Use npm install to install the dependencies. Use npm run build, and keep it running, when something updated, it can update it in real time Open a new terminal ‘npm start’ to start the project, use web server to visit localhost:3000 to see the web.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. API-What is the meaning of symbol tables?-Associate values to each key. To be more specific, to implements Key-Value pair abstraction. Key-Value pair abstraction Insert a value with specified key Given a key, search for the corresbonding value Ex. DNS lookup Insert URL with specified IP address Given URL, find corresponding IP address Some conventions Values are not null Method get() returns null if the key not present Method put() overwrites old value with new valuea Equality testAll Java classes inherit a method equals. To design equals, some standard recipe are following: Optimization for reference equality Check against null Check that to objects are of the same type and cast Compare each significant field: if field is a primitive type, use == if field is an object, use object.equals() if field is an array, apply to each entry (or Arrays.equals(a,b) but not a.equals(b)) Ex. Input a file, contains many words, output the word with max freqency123456789101112131415161718192021public class FrequencyCounter&#123; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; int minlen = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); ST&lt;String, Integer&gt; st = new ST&lt;String,Integer&gt;(); while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) &#123; //read the string and update freqency String word = StdIn.readString(); if (word.length() &lt; minlen) continue; //ignore short strings if (!st.contains(word)) st.put(word, 1); else st.put(word, st.get(word) + 1); &#125; String max = ""; st.put(max, 0); for (String word : st.keys()) if (st.get(word) &gt; st.get(max)) max = word; StdOut.println(max + " " + st.get(max)); //Print the string with max freq &#125;&#125; 2.

Important function for binary search: How many keys &lt; k ? 12345678910111213141516171819202122public Value get(Key key)&#123; if (isEmpty()) return null; int i = rank(key); if (i &lt; N &amp;&amp; keys[i].compareTo(key) == 0) return vals[i]; else return null;&#125;//return the number of keys &lt; kprivate int rank(Key key)&#123; int lo = 0, hi = N-1; while (lo &lt;= hi) //Binary search &#123; int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2; int cmp = key.compareTo(keys[mid]); if (cmp &lt; 0) hi = mid - 1; else if (cmp &gt; 0) lo = mid + 1; else if (cmp == 0) return mid; &#125; return lo; &#125; The Summary of two ways is listed Obveresly, these two ways are not efficient enough, some optimization is still needed.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[HELLO THERE,This is my blog, posted on my own github.I created it by Hexo. Many themes tried, and Next is selected. Why I build this blog?I build this blog intending to write something for my coding life. I just followed a web course about algorithm and found that it was so inefficient to work out algorithm problems without discussion. I should make some conclusion on it to intensify the memory of these knowledge. At the same time, this blog can help me to : save my junk writing English learn about how to use my new Macbook Pro learn about how to use git to manage my project learn about Markdown, a language to write blog, which I am using to type this word What will I do on this blog? Conclusions about algorithm, problem oriented Some of my projects details Maybe some diary? Maybe some thoughts on movies, series or music A request to whom read this blogWell…… I am a little bit LAZY. So if you find that there is long time after the last article, please kindly remind me to write something. In the endAs all the coders do at the beginng… Hello World!]]></content>
