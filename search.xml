Why I build this blog?I build this blog intending to write something for my coding life. I just followed a web course about algorithm and found that it was so inefficient to work out algorithm problems without discussion. I should make some conclusion on it to intensify the memory of these knowledge. At the same time, this blog can help me to : save my junk writing English learn about how to use my new Macbook Pro learn about how to use git to manage my project learn about Markdown, a language to write blog, which I am using to type this word What will I do on this blog? Conclusions about algorithm, problem oriented Some of my projects details Maybe some diary? Maybe some thoughts on movies, series or music A request to whom read this blogWell…… I am a little bit LAZY. So if you find that there is long time after the last article, please kindly remind me to write something. In the endAs all the coders do at the beginng… Hello World!]]></content>
