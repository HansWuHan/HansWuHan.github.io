    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Pigeonhole principleIn mathematics, the pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n &gt; m &gt; 0, then at least one container must contain more than one item. Bucket sort is a generalization of pigeonhole sort. It works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a distribution sort, and is a cousin of radix sort in the most to least significant digit flavour. Bucket sort works as follows: Set up an array of initially empty “buckets”. Scatter: Go over the original array, putting each object in its bucket. Sort each non-empty bucket. Gather: Visit the buckets in order and put all elements back into the original array. Leetcode 164 Maximum Gap is a problem using bucket sort. Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.Try to solve it in linear time/space.Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range. The straightforward solution is quicksort the array and then find the gap, but quicksort consumes O(NlogN) time. It reuqires O(N) time and O(N) space. That is a basic feature of bucket sort, so I choose Bucket Sort as the method. In this question, bucket sort contains several steps: 1.Find the bucket sizeThe easiest way is to set the bucket size as 1. If the requirement is to sort and return the array, it is the fastest way (although consumes extra large space). In this question, set the bucket size as 1 will exceed time limit. So the 1st thing to do is to find the bucket size.123456789// get the max and min value of the arrayint min = num[0];int max = num[0];for (int i:num) &#123; min = Math.min(min, i); max = Math.max(max, i);&#125;// the minimum possibale gap, ceiling of the integer divisionint gap = (int)Math.ceil((double)(max - min)/(num.length - 1)); Suppose there are N elements in the array, the min value is min and the max value is max. Then the maximum gap will be no smaller than gap = ceiling((max - min) / (N - 1)). Set the bucket size to gap, that can promise the max gap is between two numbers in two different buckets rather than in the same bucket. 2.Put the numbers in buckets123456789101112int[] bucketsMIN = new int[num.length - 1]; // store the min value in that bucketint[] bucketsMAX = new int[num.length - 1]; // store the max value in that bucket// put numbers into bucketsfor (int i:num) &#123; if (i == min || i == max) continue; int idx = (i - min) / gap; // index of the right position in the buckets bucketsMIN[idx] = Math.min(i, bucketsMIN[idx]); bucketsMAX[idx] = Math.max(i, bucketsMAX[idx]);&#125; In every bucket, the array bucketsMIN and bucketsMAX saves the min and max elements in every bucket. The max gap is between two adjacent buckets and maxgap = bucketsMAX[i] - bucketsMIN[i-1]. 3.find the max gap1234567891011121314// scan the buckets for the max gapint maxGap = Integer.MIN_VALUE;int previous = min;for (int i = 0; i &lt; num.length - 1; i++) &#123; if (bucketsMIN[i] == Integer.MAX_VALUE &amp;&amp; bucketsMAX[i] == Integer.MIN_VALUE) // empty bucket continue; // min value minus the previous value is the current gap maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, bucketsMIN[i] - previous); // update previous bucket value previous = bucketsMAX[i];&#125;maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, max - previous); // updata the final max value gap the completed solution is following:12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940public class Solution &#123;public int maximumGap(int[] num) &#123; if (num == null || num.length &lt; 2) return 0; // get the max and min value of the array int min = num[0]; int max = num[0]; for (int i:num) &#123; min = Math.min(min, i); max = Math.max(max, i); &#125; // the minimum possibale gap, ceiling of the integer division int gap = (int)Math.ceil((double)(max - min)/(num.length - 1)); int[] bucketsMIN = new int[num.length - 1]; // store the min value in that bucket int[] bucketsMAX = new int[num.length - 1]; // store the max value in that bucket Arrays.fill(bucketsMIN, Integer.MAX_VALUE); Arrays.fill(bucketsMAX, Integer.MIN_VALUE); // put numbers into buckets for (int i:num) &#123; if (i == min || i == max) continue; int idx = (i - min) / gap; // index of the right position in the buckets bucketsMIN[idx] = Math.min(i, bucketsMIN[idx]); bucketsMAX[idx] = Math.max(i, bucketsMAX[idx]); &#125; // scan the buckets for the max gap int maxGap = Integer.MIN_VALUE; int previous = min; for (int i = 0; i &lt; num.length - 1; i++) &#123; if (bucketsMIN[i] == Integer.MAX_VALUE &amp;&amp; bucketsMAX[i] == Integer.MIN_VALUE) // empty bucket continue; // min value minus the previous value is the current gap maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, bucketsMIN[i] - previous); // update previous bucket value previous = bucketsMAX[i]; &#125; maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, max - previous); // updata the final max value gap return maxGap;&#125;]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Dutch National Flag]]></title>
    <url>%2F2017%2F05%2F24%2FDutch-National-Flag%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Dijkstra used the Dutch National Flag Problem as a structured programming exercise in program derivation and program proof. Given N objects coloured red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same colour are adjacent, with the colours in the order red, white and blue. Similar Problem on LeetCode : 75. Sort ColorsGiven an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively. Note:You are not suppose to use the library’s sort function for this problem.click to show follow up. Follow up:A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.First, iterate the array counting number of 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s, then overwrite array with total number of 0’s, then 1’s and followed by 2’s.Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space? 1. Two-pass solution based on bucket sortObviously, this is a sort problem and it only contains 3 kinds of elements: red, white and blue, which reminds me of bucket sort. Use 3 integers to record the number of 3 colors in the 1st pass, then sort the array in the second pass. 123456789101112131415public class Solution &#123; public void sortColors(int[] A) &#123; int numRed = 0, numWhite = 0, numBlue = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; A.length; i++) &#123; if (A[i] == 0) numRed++; else if (A[i] == 1) numWhite++; else numBlue++; &#125; for (int i = 0; i &lt; A.length; i++) &#123; if (i &lt; numRed) A[i] = 0; else if (i &lt; numRed + numWhite) A[i] = 1; else A[i] = 2; &#125; &#125; &#125; 2. One-pass solution with 2 pointers in two waysAs follow-up requires, two-pass solution is not efficient enough. There should be one way to find elements and sort array at the same time. swap is used in this solution. Use two pointers end0 and head2 to record the end of 0 and the head of 2 during the process, respectively. At the beginning, end0 = 0, head2 = n - 1, where n is the length of array; When traverse all the elements, if it is 0, swap it with end0; If it is ‘2’, swap it with head2. Attention: if the element is 2, you cannot just swap it with head2 and go on, it may possible that the element at head2 is 0, so it is important to do extra check before moving on. On the contrary, the swap with end0 do not need extra check because element at end0 is sorted.12345678910111213141516171819public class Solution &#123; public void sortColors(int[] nums) &#123; int n = nums.length; int end0 = 0, head2 = n - 1, i = 0; while(i &lt;= head2) &#123; if(nums[i] == 0) swap(nums, end0++, i++); else if(nums[i] == 2) swap(nums, head2--, i); else i++; &#125; &#125; private void swap(int[] nums, int i1, int i2) &#123; int tmp = nums[i1]; nums[i1] = nums[i2]; nums[i2] = tmp; &#125;&#125; 3. One-pass solution with 3 pointers in one wayThere is one more easy way to solve this problem. The pointers only move in one way, and no swap is needed. All 3 pointers start from the head of array, record the end of 0,1,2.123456789101112131415161718public class Solution&#123; public void sortColors(int A[], int n) &#123; int n0 = -1, n1 = -1, n2 = -1; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) &#123; if (A[i] == 0) &#123; A[++n2] = 2; A[++n1] = 1; A[++n0] = 0; &#125; else if (A[i] == 1) &#123; A[++n2] = 2; A[++n1] = 1; &#125; else if (A[i] == 2) &#123; A[++n2] = 2; &#125; &#125;&#125;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. NodeJSNodeJS is a server-side language based on JavaScript. Its function likes PHP, Ruby. Its function includes handle requests parse data generate &amp; send responses file operations One of the most popular framework of NodeJS is Express, an superset to NodeJS, which includes many common test to make you focus on the core things. 2. Angular 2Angular 2 is running on Browser, provides reactive experience. No need for send request and wait for response, every thing of Angular 2 happens instantly. Angular 2 is a superset to javascript.Angular 2 has some figures:1.Single page It runs one single page and updates parts of the page which need updating 2.Updates DOMIt updates the DOM to read render parts of the page which need to be updated 3.Handles routing of visual partsit will not use server for the routing. Instead, every thing works at the front end to load things faster. 4.Very reactive user experience 3. How NodeJS and Angular 2 work together When using a server-side only application, the client do not need to do any thing, just get the resource from the server. But obviously, every change of the page should have a request to server, and take which slow down the reaction of the application. Single page application can do the rendering on the client, server just need to send data to client and client will do the rendering and generate the page itself. 4. Setting up project Go to nodejs.org to download and install the latest version nodejs Open the NodeJS project and use terminal to navigate to the project folder. Use npm install to install the dependencies. Use npm run build, and keep it running, when something updated, it can update it in real time Open a new terminal ‘npm start’ to start the project, use web server to visit localhost:3000 to see the web.]]></content>
