    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. NodeJSNodeJS is a server-side language based on JavaScript. Its function likes PHP, Ruby. Its function includes handle requests parse data generate &amp; send responses file operations One of the most popular framework of NodeJS is Express, an superset to NodeJS, which includes many common test to make you focus on the core things. 2. Angular 2Angular 2 is running on Browser, provides reactive experience. No need for send request and wait for response, every thing of Angular 2 happens instantly. Angular 2 is a superset to javascript.Angular 2 has some figures:1.Single page It runs one single page and updates parts of the page which need updating 2.Updates DOMIt updates the DOM to read render parts of the page which need to be updated 3.Handles routing of visual partsit will not use server for the routing. Instead, every thing works at the front end to load things faster. 4.Very reactive user experience 3. How NodeJS and Angular 2 work together When using a server-side only application, the client do not need to do any thing, just get the resource from the server. But obviously, every change of the page should have a request to server, and take which slow down the reaction of the application. Single page application can do the rendering on the client, server just need to send data to client and client will do the rendering and generate the page itself. 4. Setting up project Go to nodejs.org to download and install the latest version nodejs Open the NodeJS project and use terminal to navigate to the project folder. Use npm install to install the dependencies. Use npm run build, and keep it running, when something updated, it can update it in real time Open a new terminal ‘npm start’ to start the project, use web server to visit localhost:3000 to see the web.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. API-What is the meaning of symbol tables?-Associate values to each key. To be more specific, to implements Key-Value pair abstraction. Key-Value pair abstraction Insert a value with specified key Given a key, search for the corresbonding value Ex. DNS lookup Insert URL with specified IP address Given URL, find corresponding IP address Some conventions Values are not null Method get() returns null if the key not present Method put() overwrites old value with new valuea Equality testAll Java classes inherit a method equals. To design equals, some standard recipe are following: Optimization for reference equality Check against null Check that to objects are of the same type and cast Compare each significant field: if field is a primitive type, use == if field is an object, use object.equals() if field is an array, apply to each entry (or Arrays.equals(a,b) but not a.equals(b)) Ex. Input a file, contains many words, output the word with max freqency123456789101112131415161718192021public class FrequencyCounter&#123; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; int minlen = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); ST&lt;String, Integer&gt; st = new ST&lt;String,Integer&gt;(); while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) &#123; //read the string and update freqency String word = StdIn.readString(); if (word.length() &lt; minlen) continue; //ignore short strings if (!st.contains(word)) st.put(word, 1); else st.put(word, st.get(word) + 1); &#125; String max = ""; st.put(max, 0); for (String word : st.keys()) if (st.get(word) &gt; st.get(max)) max = word; StdOut.println(max + " " + st.get(max)); //Print the string with max freq &#125;&#125; 2. Elementary ST implementation2.1 Sequential search in a linked listData structureMaintain an (unordered) linked list of key-value pairs.SearchScan through all keys until find a match.InsertScan through all keys until find a match; if no match add to front. 2.2 Binary Search in an ordered arrayData structureMaintain an ordered array of key-value pairs.SearchBinary SearchInsertNeed to shift all greater keys over. Important function for binary search: How many keys &lt; k ? 12345678910111213141516171819202122public Value get(Key key)&#123; if (isEmpty()) return null; int i = rank(key); if (i &lt; N &amp;&amp; keys[i].compareTo(key) == 0) return vals[i]; else return null;&#125;//return the number of keys &lt; kprivate int rank(Key key)&#123; int lo = 0, hi = N-1; while (lo &lt;= hi) //Binary search &#123; int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2; int cmp = key.compareTo(keys[mid]); if (cmp &lt; 0) hi = mid - 1; else if (cmp &gt; 0) lo = mid + 1; else if (cmp == 0) return mid; &#125; return lo; &#125; The Summary of two ways is listed Obveresly, these two ways are not efficient enough, some optimization is still needed. Which will be discussed next. 3. Ordered OperationNormally, Ordered symbol table should have the following API 123456789101112131415161718192021public class ST&lt;Key extends Comparable&lt;Key&gt;, Value&gt;&#123; ST(); // create an ordered symbol table void put(Key key, Value val); //put key-value pair into the table (remove key from table if value is null) Value get(Key key); //value paired with key (null if key is absent) void delete(Key key); //remove key (and its value) from table boolean contains(Key key); //is there a value paired with key? boolean isEmpty(); //is the table empty? int size(); //number of key-value pairs Key min(); //smallest key Key max(); //largest key Key floor(Key key); //largest key less than or equal to key Key ceiling(Key key); //smallest key greater than or equal to key int rank(Key key); //number of keys less than key Key select(int k); //key of rank k void deleteMin(); //delete smallest key void deleteMax(); //delete largest key int size(Key lo, Key hi); //number of keys in [lo..hi] Iterable&lt;Key&gt; keys(Key lo, Key hi); //keys in [lo..hi], in sorted order Iterable&lt;Key&gt; keys(); //all keys in the table, in sorted order&#125;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[HELLO THERE,This is my blog, posted on my own github.I created it by Hexo. Many themes tried, and Next is selected. Why I build this blog?I build this blog intending to write something for my coding life. I just followed a web course about algorithm and found that it was so inefficient to work out algorithm problems without discussion. I should make some conclusion on it to intensify the memory of these knowledge. At the same time, this blog can help me to : save my junk writing English learn about how to use my new Macbook Pro learn about how to use git to manage my project learn about Markdown, a language to write blog, which I am using to type this word What will I do on this blog? Conclusions about algorithm, problem oriented Some of my projects details Maybe some diary? Maybe some thoughts on movies, series or music A request to whom read this blogWell…… I am a little bit LAZY. So if you find that there is long time after the last article, please kindly remind me to write something. In the endAs all the coders do at the beginng… Hello World!]]></content>
